# YLE-Areena episode downloader
Get all episodes listed on a page and download them, if not yet downloaded.<br>
All YLE TV-series have their own episode listing page, where all episodes are listed. This PHP script loops them through and downloads all episodes if their local video file does not yet exist.

## TODO
 * A better way of listing all series that must be collected, MySQL/CSV?
 * Collect episode description to a searchable database
